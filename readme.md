# Lecture Slider

This python utility will take a subtitled video and create a slideshow of images.

## Quickstart

With conda:

```
# Create the environment for conda
conda env create environment.yml

# Activate environment
conda activate lectureslider

# run python script
python generator.py

```

Output will be in output folder.  This is a pretty rudimentary version of this function.  The youtube parser does this a little more robustly.  This is more of a proof of concept project.
