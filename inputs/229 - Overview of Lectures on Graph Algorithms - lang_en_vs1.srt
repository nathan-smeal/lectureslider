00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,445
The next section is about graph algorithms.

2
00:00:02,445 --> 00:00:05,498
I'm sure you've all seen the basic graph algorithms before;

3
00:00:05,498 --> 00:00:07,025
DFS for depth-first search,

4
00:00:07,025 --> 00:00:11,715
BFS for breadth-first search and Dijkstra's single source shortest path algorithm.

5
00:00:11,715 --> 00:00:14,220
We'll do a quick review of how DFS is used to

6
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:16,950
find the connected components of an undirected graph,

7
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:20,905
and then we'll build on that to look at connectivity in directed graphs.

8
00:00:20,905 --> 00:00:25,825
We'll use DFS to find the strongly connected components of directed graphs.

9
00:00:25,825 --> 00:00:29,265
These are the analog of connected components in directed graphs.

10
00:00:29,265 --> 00:00:30,960
And then we'll see an application of

11
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:35,850
our strongly connected component algorithm to solve the two set problem.

12
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:39,165
Next, we'll look at the minimum spanning tree problem, MSTs.

13
00:00:39,165 --> 00:00:43,835
You've likely seen that Kruskal's and Prim's algorithm before for finding an MST.

14
00:00:43,835 --> 00:00:46,710
We'll look at the correctness behind these algorithms.

15
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:48,985
Finally, we'll look at the PageRank algorithm.

16
00:00:48,985 --> 00:00:51,600
This is the algorithm that looks at the Web graph and assigns

17
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,690
weights to vertices or webpages.

18
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:56,660
It's a measure of their importance.

19
00:00:56,660 --> 00:00:59,095
This algorithm was devised by Brin and Page,

20
00:00:59,095 --> 00:01:01,410
and it's at the heart of Google's search engine.

21
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:03,654
To understand the PageRank algorithm,

22
00:01:03,654 --> 00:01:06,180
I'll first give you a quick primer on Markov chains,

23
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:09,410
and then you'll see how it relates to strongly connected components.
